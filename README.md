The Python script performs the following steps in sequence:

Data Loading and Inspection

    A sample sales dataset is generated and saved as a CSV file (sample_sales_data.csv). This makes the script self-contained and runnable out-of-the-box.

    The dataset is then loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

    The .head() and .info() methods are used to inspect the data's structure, including column types and missing values.

Data Cleaning

    The script demonstrates how to handle missing data.

    Missing numerical values in the Sales column are imputed (filled) with the mean of the column.

    Rows with missing categorical values in the Category column are dropped, as a missing category can be a critical issue for analysis.

Data Visualization

The script generates four different types of plots to visualize key aspects of the sales data:

    Line Chart: Shows the daily sales trend over time, allowing for the easy identification of patterns or seasonality.

    Bar Chart: Compares the average sales across different product categories, providing a clear side-by-side comparison.

    Histogram: Displays the distribution of sales values, helping to understand the frequency of different sales amounts.

    Scatter Plot: Visualizes the relationship between Sales and Quantity, to explore whether higher sales correspond to larger quantities sold.

Each visualization is customized with a title and labeled axes for clarity.
